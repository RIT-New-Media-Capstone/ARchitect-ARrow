# ARchitect-ARrow
Phil Kalinowski, Olivia Lewis & Abraham Furlan

## Overview
In brief, this application is used for AR Direction when navigating our world through a mobile device. For this project in particular, usage is primarily for Android users through the Flutter/Dart coding environment.


The application uses concepts like Google Maps and other GPS-like devices/applications and provides a clearer sense of direction from the user's point of view, rather than the typical satellite point of view. The app allows the user to select/set their destination, opens their camera, and then gives the user a clear and dynamic AR arrow to serve as a guide, leading the user to the chosen location
